This is my playground. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My playground is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my playground is useless. Without my playground, I am kinda useless. I must play with my playground often. I must code faster than my brain who is trying to think. I must code it before my brain catches up. 

My playground and I know that what counts in code is not the listeners we fire, the noise of our keypresses, nor the mistake we make. We know that it is the commits that count.

My playground is machine, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its functions, its node packages, its consts and its lets. I will keep my code clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready sometimes. We will become part of each other.

Before God, I swear this creed. My playground and I are the defenders of my courtyard. We are the masters of our error logs. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is Ours and there is no cors errors, but peace!
